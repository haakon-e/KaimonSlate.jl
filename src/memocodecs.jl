# Memo codecs — how a binding VALUE becomes blob BYTES (and back). The manifest's per-name
# `codec` field names one of these; "jls" (Serialization) is the universal fallback. The fast
# codecs exist for the multi-GB case, where JLS's slow object-graph walk turns
# "instant reopen" into minutes:
#   raw    isbits Arrays — a self-describing header + the raw bytes. When the graph
#          proves the binding is never mutated downstream (`zc`), restore MMAPs the immutable
#          CAS blob read-only: zero-copy, ~ms, no RSS. Else it materializes a copy (bulk
#          read, GB/s — still ≫ JLS).
#   arrow  DataFrame — PURE Arrow IPC file bytes, deliberately NO envelope: the blob mmaps
#          straight off disk (`Arrow.Table(path)`), zero-copy-sends over ZMQ
#          (zmq_msg_init_data wraps the mapped pages), and stays readable by duckdb/pyarrow.
#          Soft-detected (Arrow + DataFrames loaded in this process — the tables.jl
#          precedent); absent packages simply mean "jls" at store time and a clean miss →
#          recompute at restore time.
# Zero-copy safety: a read-only mmap makes a later mutation THROW (ReadOnlyMemoryError)
# rather than corrupt the CAS — the safe failure mode when the graph gained a mutating cell
# AFTER the entry was stored (the safe-set is store-time knowledge). One re-run of the
# producer re-stores the entry in copy mode.
